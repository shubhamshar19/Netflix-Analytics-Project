Netflix Analytics Project


Hello Everyone I am Shubham Sharma
An aspiring data analyst, I applied my SQL and Power BI skills to analyze Netflix’s content library, uncovering key insights into content distribution, audience ratings, geographical trends, genres, and creator contributions.

This dashboard transforms raw data into business-ready insights that highlight how Netflix balances global and local strategies to engage diverse audiences.


**Business  Problem**

Netflix has thousands of movies and TV shows in its library, but without digging into the data, it’s hard to answer simple yet important questions like -

1) Which type of content (Movies vs. TV Shows) dominates the library?

2) What are the most common ratings and genres consumed by audiences?

3) Which countries contribute the most content to Netflix?

4) How do release trends vary year by year and across regions like India?  e.t.c


For this project, I explored the Netflix dataset using SQL and wrote queries to uncover key insights on content distribution, ratings, genres, countries, and creators. I then brought everything together in Power BI, designing an interactive dashboard that transforms raw data into easy-to-understand insights—bridging Netflix’s content library with real business questions.



**SQL Queries**


1) Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows ?

2) Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows ?

3) List All Movies Released in a Specific Year (e.g., 2020) ?

4) Find the Top 5 Countries with the Most Content on Netflix ?

5) Identify the Longest Movie ?

6) Find Content Added in the Last 5 Years ?

7) Find All Movies/TV Shows by Director 'Rajiv Chilaka'

8) Count the Number of Content Items in Each Genre ?

9) Find each year and the average numbers of content release in India on netflix.

10) List All Movies that are Documentaries ?

11) Find All Content Without a Director ?

12) Find How Many Movies Actor 'Salman Khan' Appeared in the Last 10 Years ?

13) Find the Top 10 Actors Who Have Appeared in the Highest Number of Movies Produced in  India ?

14) Categorize Content Based on the Presence of 'Kill' and 'Violence' Keywords



**Analysis Report**

Netflix’s library is vast and diverse, but through this analysis, some clear patterns emerged. Movies make up the bulk of the catalog, while TV shows—especially multi-season ones—play a big role in keeping audiences engaged over time. Ratings revealed how Netflix balances family-friendly content with more mature options, appealing to very different audience groups. Geographically, the U.S. and India dominate the platform’s content supply, with India showing noticeable spikes in releases during certain years as Netflix strengthened its regional presence. Genres like documentaries carve out a unique niche, while long-running shows and experimental formats highlight the platform’s variety.

Looking at the people behind the content, we see how much influence creators have on shaping Netflix’s library. Directors like Rajiv Chilaka and actors such as Salman Khan continue to have a strong presence, reflecting the pull of popular names. At the same time, the top actors list for Indian content shows how deeply Bollywood influences Netflix’s catalog. Keyword analysis even helped separate “light” versus “dark” themes, offering a fresh lens on how content is described and consumed. Altogether, this project shows how SQL and Power BI can turn raw rows of data into meaningful insights about Netflix’s global strategy, giving us a better understanding of how the platform grows, adapts, and entertains audiences worldwide.

This project really helped me sharpen my SQL skills for digging into data and use Power BI to bring those findings to life. More than just charts and numbers, it showed me how data can tell a story that answers real business questions. Looking ahead, I’d love to take this further by exploring predictive analysis—like forecasting which genres or regions might see the biggest growth on Netflix in the future.

Thankyou for your time & attention
